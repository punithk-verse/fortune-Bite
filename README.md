🥠 FortuneBite

Your breakfast decides your destiny.

FortuneBite is a playful little web app that predicts how your day might go based on what you ate for breakfast. It’s inspired by classic fortune cookies, but with a fun twist — instead of cracking open a cookie, you tell the app what you had for breakfast and it does the predicting for you 🍳🍪

🌟 What does it do?

You choose what you ate for breakfast (idli, dosa, cereal, pizza… or nothing 😄)

You click Open Cookie 🍪

A fortune appears with a little animation, sound, and confetti

The app even remembers your last fortune

No accounts. No tracking. Just fun.
